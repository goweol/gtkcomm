GTK communication program (serial and telnet)

With this program, you can control the embedded system via serial port
or telnet.  Though I could use minicom or screen, those programs has no
features I want, especially RICH script language, logging and more.

This program is based on 'gau 0.4.x' which was created by 'ChiDeok Hwang
<hwang at kldp dot org>'.   Many thanks to him.
